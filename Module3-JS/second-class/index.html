<!--1D (One-Dimensional Array): This is the most basic type of array, consisting of a linear sequence of elements. Each element is accessed using a single index. For example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is a one-dimensional array.

2D (Two-Dimensional Array): Also known as a matrix, a two-dimensional array consists of rows and columns, forming a grid-like structure. Elements are accessed using two indices (row and column). Example: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]].

Multi-Dimensional Array: Arrays with more than two dimensions are called multi-dimensional arrays. They extend the concept of two-dimensional arrays to higher dimensions. Example: [[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]]. -->
